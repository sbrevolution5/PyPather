# PyPather
An interactive pathfinding visualization written in python with pygame and tkinter

# Goals
 a. A grid where the user can select two points, and an animated pathfinding algorithm (initially using a*) will find a path in between
 b. allow the user to draw obstacles on the grid, which the algorithm will have to avoid.
 c. allow for different pathfinding algorithms to be used
 d. allow for a "race" between different algorithms.
